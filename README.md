# 📊 Basic ML Techniques: Spam Filter with Naive Bayes

This project demonstrates foundational machine learning techniques through the implementation of a **spam email classifier** using **Naive Bayes**. The notebook walks through a full pipeline — from preprocessing raw text data to evaluating a predictive model — and is a great starting point for those learning ML and natural language processing (NLP).

- Understand basic **text classification** using machine learning
- Apply **Naive Bayes** to a real-world problem: spam detection
- Explore and visualize text data
- Learn how to prepare text data using **NLP preprocessing steps**
- Evaluate classification performance using metrics like accuracy
